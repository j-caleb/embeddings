# Overview

I am creating a series of tutorials where I implement things from scratch and try to make things as easy to understand as possible. Code wise I am trying to make the implementations as easy to understand as possible. Long term ... I have no idea where this is headed, but for now I am starting with one of my favorite areas which is distributional semantics. Many people think all of this started with word2vec. It didn't. There is a lot of history and various methods leading up to where we are now. To me at least, the current innovations are even more interesting when they are placed in their historical context.

For now I plan to cover the following:

Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL)
Latent Semantic Analysis
Random Indexing
Binary Spatter Code
Topic Modeling (LDA)
word2vec
At some point I will ad basic tutorials on vector operations and fundamentals.

Note: This is very early work in progress.

# Implemented modules

## Random Indexing

Status: ~80% complete
